/*Question 47: Pooja would like to withdraw X $US from an ATM.
The cash machine will only accept the transaction if X is a multiple of 5,
and Pooja's account balance has enough cash to perform the withdrawal transaction (including bank charges).
For each successful withdrawal the bank charges 0.50 $US.
Calculate Pooja's account balance after an attempted transaction.
Input
Positive integer 0 < X <= 2000 - the amount of cash which Pooja wishes to withdraw. 
Nonnegative number 0<= Y <= 2000 with two digits of precision - Pooja's initial account balance. 
Output
Output the account balance after the attempted transaction, given as a number with two digits of precision.
 If there is not enough money in the account to complete the transaction, output the current bank balance.
Example - Successful Transaction Input:
30 120.00
Output:
89.50
Example - Incorrect Withdrawal Amount (not multiple of 5) Input:
42 120.00
Output:
120.00
Example - Insufficient Funds Input:
300 120.00
Output:
120.00

Explanation
30 is multiple of 5.
Total deduction = 30 + 0.50 = 30.50
Remaining balance = 120 ? 30.50 = 89.50
